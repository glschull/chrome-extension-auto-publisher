# Privacy Policy for Copy Table to Google Sheets

_Last updated: May 4, 2025_

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the "Copy Table to Google Sheets" Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about data practices.

## Information Collection and Usage

### What information we collect

Our extension only collects the following limited information:

1. **Table data**: When you explicitly right-click on a table and select "Copy Table to Google Sheets", our extension extracts the content of that HTML table.
2. **Google account information**: We use Google's OAuth authentication to verify your identity and create Google Sheets on your behalf.
3. **User preferences**: We store your preferences locally (such as whether to auto-format tables or automatically open sheets).

### How we use your information

- **Table data** is only processed temporarily to copy it to Google Sheets. This data is sent directly to Google's servers through your own authenticated Google account. We do not store or process this data on our servers.
- **Google account information** is only used to authenticate you with Google Sheets API. We only request the minimum required permissions (specifically the "spreadsheets" scope).
- **User preferences** are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. These preferences are never transmitted to our servers.

### What information we do NOT collect

- We do not collect browsing history
- We do not collect personal information beyond what's provided through Google authentication
- We do not track your activity across websites
- We do not use cookies or similar technologies
- We do not collect any analytics or usage statistics

## Data Sharing

We do not share any user data with third parties. The only data transmission occurs between your browser and Google's servers when creating a spreadsheet, and this happens using your own Google account authentication.

## Data Storage

- User preferences are stored locally using Chrome's storage API
- No user data is stored on our servers
- Table data is only transmitted directly to Google's servers using your own authentication

## User Rights

Since we don't collect or store your personal data on our servers, there's no need for a data access or deletion process. Your Google account data is managed by Google according to their privacy policy.

If you wish to remove stored preferences, you can:
1. Right-click the extension icon
2. Select "Options"
3. Click "Sign Out" (to remove Google authentication)
4. Uninstall the extension (to remove all local storage)

## Security

We implement best practices to ensure your data is secure:
- We use Google's OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authentication
- We request only the minimum necessary permissions
- We don't store your data on our servers

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
