# Extension Icons

Replace these placeholder files with your actual extension icons in the specified sizes:

- `16.png` - 16×16 pixels
- `48.png` - 48×48 pixels
- `128.png` - 128×128 pixels

The icons should be in PNG format and follow the [Chrome Extension icon guidelines](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/icons/).

## Icon Design Tips

1. Use simple, recognizable imagery that represents your extension's function
2. Make sure your icons are legible even at the smaller sizes
3. Maintain consistent branding across all icon sizes
4. Use transparency appropriately
5. Test your icons in both light and dark browser themes
